<h1>3D models</h1>

This repository contains 3D models used in various projects of mine.<br/>
Each project is organized in a separate folder.

___

Most models are designed using the OpenSCAD tool:<br/>
https://openscad.org/<br/>
Use this tool to generate STL files.<br/>
<br/>
I used the BOSL2 library for designing. <br/>
Here is the documentation and installation instructions for the library:<br/>

<br/>
Each model contains variables that allow you to customize it.<br/>
Sometimes, I place these variables in "\*vars\*.scad" files.<br/>
Usually, the variables include short descriptions; <br/>
However, you can also figure out what each variable does <br/>
by changing its value and observing how the 3D model changes.
